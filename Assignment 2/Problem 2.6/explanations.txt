a) Error message says 'string', 'cout', 'endl' and other functions were not declared in the scope.
	This means that each function in the 'std' namespace would need to be declared
	before its use, i.e. 'std::cout'.
   'using namesapce std;' is a declaration for every function in the 'std' namespace.

b) Removing the 'Critter ::' prefix results in a declaration error where the variables in the
functions that need to be changed are undeclared as the class 'Critter', in which these variables
have been defined, has been removed from the declaration of the function.
